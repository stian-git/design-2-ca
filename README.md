## Description

This is not an actual site, but an example of a Style Guide I often start my projects with.I usually use Adobe XD for the design and sketches, but getting a decent layout like this with HTML and CSS gives me the visual confirmation of my project before I start developing.

In this project the task was to build a new design for an existing site. I selected the existing homepage [https://ski.slil.no/](https://ski.slil.no/) for this project.

The colors found in the logo is an important part of the clubs identity, so I wanted to reuse those as an important part of the style.

The content of this single page shows the relations of typography, navigation, footer and how different components can be visualised (images, results, buttons, forms, etc)

Some design considerations in this project:

- Brand-continuity
- Redesign
- Typography
- Styling of components
- Color Selections
- Layout Design
